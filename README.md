# Speed Of Light

## Objectives

The objective is to use Python with the Kivy Framework.
This project is different from usual because I wanted to relax on a domain I am interested in: Game Development.

So this was the good opportunity to try to use Python for something different. But even if this is not a pro website, I can improve my skills!

## Rules

The idea is to control a spaceship and avoid obstacles. It is like a Rhythm Game... Not sure about that, but let's see !

## Feelings

This was fun to use the Kivy Framework to create a desktop/mobile app.
I knew it was going to be complicated, and the mathematical function to transform my 2D plan into a perspective with vanishing point was complicated.
I wanted to do maths, and I am pleased I did it !

Made it !
